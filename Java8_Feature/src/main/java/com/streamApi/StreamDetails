	**Methods in Stream** 		   
	
	1) Intermediate Method - This kind 0f method never gives us a final result, it always return a new stream object.
	
		## Commonly used intermediate methods ->  	
		
		[A] map() -> It returns a another stream, consisting result of given function.
		
		[B] filter() -> It returns a filter element stream based on the predicate condition.
		
		[c] sorted() -> It is used to sort the stream.
		
		
		
			
	2) Terminal method -> This methods returns the final result of stream object and after this we can not use stream object again.
	
		## Commonly used intermediate methods ->  	
		
		
		[A] collect() -> used to return the final result of stream object.
		
		[B] forEach() -> used to iterate through each element.
		
		[c] reduce() -> It reduce the element of stream object and gives a single value as final result.
